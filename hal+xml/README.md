# hal+xml I-D

This repository is intended to contain an Internet-Draft for the application/hal+xml media type.

A note about the author:

My focus for the past 10 years has been around Systems, Data, Infrastructure Architecture and DevOps. More recently however, I was tasked to understand REST APIs so that I could design one to help expose parts data within our organization.

This journey started around mid 2013 and lasted well over a year. It took awhile getting to a point where I felt comfortable because I kept seeing discrepancies between what was commonly understood and what Roy Fielding's dissertation was telling me.

I eventually got around to the rebranding effort "Hypermedia API" which is an attempt to refocus attention toward a particular aspect of REST (i.e. Hypermedia as the engine of application state) that has, up until recently, remained dormant except perhaps in a few marginal API implementations.

I still have some work to do to close the gap on some of the finer aspects of the REST architectural style but I've benefited from the feedback of a community of very motivated and very knowledgeable folks (in particular on the HAL Discuss and Hypermedia Web Google Groups).

I'm sharing back in the form of this Internet-Draft for the application/hal+xml media type and I intend to submit it after getting a bit of feedback from the community.

There's a good thread going on the Hal Discuss google group [1]. Join in and help shape the spec!
