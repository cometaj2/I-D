# I-D

This repository is intended to contain an Interet-Draft for the application/hal+xml media type.

A note about the author:

My focus for the past 10 years has been around Systems, Data, Infrastructure Architecture and DevOps. More recently however, I was tasked to understand REST APIs so that I could design one to help expose parts data within our organization.

This journey started around mid 2013 and lasted well over a year. It took awhile getting to a point where I felt comfortable because I kept seeing discrepancies between what was commonly understood and what Roy Fielding's dissertation was telling me.

I eventually got around to the rebranding effort "Hypermedia API" which is an attempt to refocus attention toward an aspect of REST that has been, up until now, remained dormant except perhaps in a few marginal implementations.

I still have some work to do to close the gap on some of the finer aspects of the REST architectural style but I've benefited from the feedback of a community of very motivated and very knowledgeable folks (in particular the HAL Discuss and Hypermedia Web Google Groups).

I'm sharing back in the form of this Internet-Draft for the application/hal+xml media type and I intend to submit it after getting a bit of feedback from the community.
