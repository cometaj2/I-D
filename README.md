# Internet Drafts

This repository is intended to contain various Internet-Draft I'm working on.

A note about the author:

My focus for the past 10 years has been around systems, data, infrastructure architecture, development and operations. More recently however, I have focused my attention to REST APIs.

This journey started around mid 2013 and lasted well over a year. It took a while to get to a point where I felt comfortable because I kept seeing discrepancies between what was commonly understood and what Roy Fielding's dissertation was telling me about REST.

I eventually got around to the rebranding effort, "Hypermedia", which is an attempt to refocus attention toward a particular aspect of REST (i.e. Hypermedia as the engine of application state; HATEOAS) that had, up until recently, remained dormant except perhaps in a few marginal API implementations.

I still have some work to do to close the gap on some of the finer aspects of the REST architectural style, but I've benefited from the feedback of a community of very motivated and very knowledgeable folks (in particular on the HAL Discuss and Hypermedia Web Google Groups).

I'm sharing back in the form of these Internet-Drafts and I intend to submit them after getting a bit of feedback from the community.
