1.  Introduction

   In order to provide coherent use of Application Level Profile
   Semantics (ALPS) [I-D.draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps] in HAL
   documents [I-D.draft-kelly-json-hal] and [I-D.draft-michaud-xml-hal],
   ALPS bindings for the HAL media-types (application/hal+json and
   application/hal+xml) must be defined.

   This specification establishes conventions required for consistent
   expression of Application Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) in HAL
   documents.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  A Review of ALPS Principles

Internet-Draft           ALPS Bindings for HAL         February 16, 2018


   The Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) [I-D.draft-amundsen-
   richardson-foster-alps] specification is designed to describe the
   data elements and state transitions that make up a problem domain
   (e.g. micro-blogging, accounting, etc.). ALPS documents are designed
   to be useful to both client and server implementers and can be used
   at both run-time and design-time to handle the generation and
   interpretation of response representations. ALPS description
   documents are referred to as "profiles" or "profile documents".

   Since the aim is to support a wide set of use cases (clients,
   servers, run-time, design-time, etc.), ALPS profiles do not describe
   the runtime behavior of any single system. Instead, ALPS profiles
   describe the problem domain boundaries (e.g. the possible data
   elements and possible state transitions). It is up to implementers to
   decide how they wish to use ALPS profiles in order to create an
   actual service instance or client application.

4.  Servers and Clients

   For server implementers, ALPS profiles establish the list of possible
   identifiers for data values (givenName, familyName, etc.) and
   transitions (publish, createUser, etc). ALPS profiles also provide
   additional description information for state transitions including
   whether the transition is safe, idempotent or unsafe and, in some
   cases, whether there are any possible arguments that can be passed
   with each transition.

   Client implementers can use the same ALPS document as a guide for
   what to expect from a service which advertises support for an ALPS
   profile. For example, if a service announces that it uses the ALPS
   profile for micro-blogging, then any client application that was
   built to support the micro-blogging profile SHOULD be able to
   recognize all the important data elements and state transitions
   emitted by that service.

5.  Advertising ALPS Profiles for HAL Representations

   Servers returning HAL documents SHOULD only advertise the ALPS
   profiles they support, using one or more of the methods described in
   the following sections.

5.1.  HAL profile link relations

   HAL documents conforming to an ALPS profile SHOULD use the standard
   profile [RFC6906] link relations HAL Link.

   The profile link relation href SHOULD be set to the URL of the
   supported ALPS profile, and the URL MAY make use of the URL fragment

   referencing a unique descriptor.id that exists in the referenced ALPS
   profile.

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/svc"
       },
       "profile": {
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/accounting#invoice"
       }
     }
   }

   As application/hal+xml:

   <resource rel="self" href="/svc">
     <link rel="profile"
           href="http://example.org/profiles/accounting#invoice"/>
   </resource>

   Precedence rules between Link Headers and HAL link relations SHOULD
   observe compliance per the ALPS specification Section 3.1. Linking to
   ALPS Documents [I-D.draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps].

5.2.  Link Header

   Responses can include the Link header, in conformance with [RFC5988].

   The profile link relation can also similarly be used.

   Link: <http://example.org/profiles/accounting>;rel="profile"

   Precedence rules between Link Headers and HAL link relations SHOULD
   observe compliance per the ALPS specification Section 3.1. Linking to
   ALPS Documents [I-D.draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps].

5.3.  Additional Considerations

   It is valid for a service to advertise support for more than one ALPS
   profile for the same response. For example, a single response from a
   server MAY include multiple HAL profile relations.

   As application/hal+json:

   {

     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/svc"
       },
       "profile": [{
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/accounting#invoice"
       },
       {
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/finance#billing"
       }]
     }
   }

   In the above case, the client application has been informed that the
   response MAY contain data elements and state transitions from both
   the accounting and finance ALPS profiles, and more specifically along
   invoicing and billing.

   Clients accepting HAL documents, and understanding ALPS semantics,
   SHOULD look for the ALPS profile in each of the mentioned places
   (.e.g. Link Header, HAL Profile link relation), as appropriate to the
   response. If an ALPS profile reference appears in more than one
   location, all profiles SHOULD be considered valid.

   Precedence rules between Link Headers and HAL link relations SHOULD
   observe compliance per the ALPS specification Section 3.1. Linking to
   ALPS Documents [I-D.draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps].

6.  ALPS Bindings for HAL

   The following sections contain details and examples on how to bind
   ALPS to HAL.

6.1.  ALPS Descriptor Bindings

   The following sections describe ALPS bindings for HAL, for the ALPS
   descriptor property.

6.1.1.  id

   The descriptor.id, with a descriptor.type set to "semantic" SHOULD
   lead to the formation of a HAL document properties with the same name
   as the descriptor.id.

   Below are valid examples for both the application/hal+json and the
   application/hal+xml media-types where the man-page semantics happen
   to align with a HAL resource boundary:

       <descriptor id="name" type="semantic" />
       <descriptor id="description" type="semantic" />
     </descriptor>
   </descriptor>

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/svc"
       },
       "profile": [{
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/man#man-page"
       }]
     },
     "section": [

         "description": "A simple formatter for JSON"
       },
       {
         "name": "synopsis",
         "description": "jsonf <command>"
       }
     ]
   }

   As application/hal+xml:

6.1.2.  name

   The descriptor.name property SHOULD be used to help differentiate
   semantics when a condition would yield the required use of multiple
   identical descriptor.ids in an ALPS profile.

   Since having multiple identical descriptor.ids in an ALPS profile
   MUST NOT occur, the descriptor.id can remain unique within an ALPS
   profile and the descriptor.name MAY be used to otherwise lead to the
   formation of an identical key or link relation but with different
   type semantics.

   The below example hints at how type semantics could be differentiated
   when a need for an identical link relation key is otherwise
   desirable:

   <!-- ALPS document fragment -->
   <descriptor id="media" type="semantic">
     <descriptor id="book" name="item" type="safe" />
     <descriptor id="movie" name="item" type="safe" />
   </descriptor>

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/svc"
       },
       "profile": [{
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/library#media"
       }], 
       "item": [{
         "href": "/svc/book/1",
         "name": "book"
       },
       {
         "href": "/svc/movie/1",
         "name": "movie"
       }]
     }
   }

   As application/hal+xml:

   <resource self="/svc">
     <link rel="profile"
           href="http://example.org/profiles/library#media"/>
     <link rel="item" href="/svc/book/1" name="book"/>
     <link rel="item" href="/svc/movie/1" name="movie"/>

6.1.3.  type

   The following sections cover how descriptor.type MAY influence HAL
   document formation and conformance.

6.1.3.1. semantic

   The descriptor.type property with a value of "semantic" is covered
   under sections covering descriptor.id and descriptor.name.

6.1.3.2. safe, unsafe, or idempotent

   If a non-semantic descriptor (e.g. "safe", "unsafe", or "idempotent")
   is contained within a semantic descriptor, then it SHOULD yield the
   formation of a link or a templated link (a form) in a HAL document.

   Note however that HAL does not support the presence of links within
   nested attributes, therefore, HAL based representations SHALL only
   coherently fulfill the intent of an ALPS profile if a non-semantic
   descriptor is contained within a semantic descriptor and if that
   semantic descriptor aligns with a HAL resource boundary. 

6.1.3.2.1.  Without a Contained Semantic Descriptor

   If a non-semantic descriptor does not contain a semantic descriptor,
   then it SHOULD yield the formation of a link.

   <!-- ALPS document fragment -->
   <descriptor id="media" type="semantic">
     <descriptor id="next" type="safe" />
   </descriptor>

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/svc"
       },
       "profile": [{
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/library#media"
       }], 
       "next": [{
         "href": "/svc/book/2",
       },
       {

         "href": "/svc/movie/2",
       }]
     }
   }

   As application/hal+xml:

   <resource self="/svc">
     <link rel="profile"
           href="http://example.org/profiles/library#media"/>
     <link rel="next" href="/svc/book/2"/>
     <link rel="next" href="/svc/movie/2"/>
   </resource>

6.1.3.2.2.  With a Contained Semantic Descriptor

   If a non-semantic descriptor contains one or more semantic
   descriptors, then it SHOULD yield the formation of a templated link
   (a form).

   <!-- ALPS document fragment -->
   <descriptor id="search" type="semantic">
     <descriptor href="#collection" />
   </descriptor>

   <descriptor id="collection" type="safe">
     <doc format="text">A search form with one input.</doc>
     <descriptor id="id" type="semantic" />
   </descriptor>

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/svc"
       },
       "profile": [{
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/search#search"
       }],
       "collection": {
         "href": "/svc/search{?id}",
         "templated" : true
       }
     }
   }

   As application/hal+xml:

   <resource self="/svc">

           href="http://example.org/profiles/search#search"/>
     <link rel="collection"
           href="/svc/search{?id}"
           templated="true"/>
   </resource>

6.1.4.  rt

   If descriptor.rt is used in conjunction with a non-semantic
   descriptor.type, it SHOULD lead to the formation of a link or form
   target profile reference with a value of descriptor.rt.

   The expected target profile, on a link or form, SHOULD NOT come in
   conflict with the actual profile of the target resource. Semantic
   conflict resolution resulting from a misalignment between an expected
   target profile and an actual profile are out of scope of this
   specification.

   The following example showcases a potentially paginated list of
   results returned when using a collection form which returns result
   hits from a string based search:

   <!-- ALPS document fragment -->
   <descriptor id="search" type="semantic">
     <descriptor href="#collection" />
     <descriptor rt="#result" name="item" type="safe" />
     <descriptor rt="#search" name="previous" type="safe"/>
     <descriptor rt="#search" name="next" type="safe"/>
     <descriptor id="results" type="semantic"/>
     <descriptor id="search-string" type="semantic"/>
   </descriptor>

   <descriptor id="collection" type="safe" rt="#search">
     <doc format="text">A search form with a string input.</doc>
     <descriptor id="string" type="semantic" />
   </descriptor>

   <descriptor id="result" type="semantic">
     <doc format="text">A returned search result.</doc>

     <descriptor id="related" type="safe" />
     <descriptor id="synopsis" type="semantic" />
     <descriptor id="ranking" type="semantic" />
   </descriptor>

7.  HAL Curies and Extension Relations

   Because of the way HAL binds link relations to the descriptor.id or

   descriptor.name in this specification, extension relations MUST
   remain exclusively and independently within the control of service
   implementers to avoid impacting existing implementations that choose
   to enhance their HAL representations with ALPS semantics. HAL CURIEs,
   used to provide extension relation documentation, MUST NOT be used to
   bind to semantic type ids or names.

   This restriction intends to favor decoupling and independent
   evolution of the documented semantics associated with extension
   relations from those associated to ALPS profiles.

   Service implementers are free to extend link relations as needed to
   provide non-conflicting, and independent, semantics.

   The following example combines a wide swath of binding semantics
   defined in this specification but specifically focuses on the HAL
   document CURIE extension relation of the bound link relation "book"
   into "ext:book":
