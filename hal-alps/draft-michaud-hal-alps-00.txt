1.  Introduction

   In order to provide coherent use of Application Level Profile
   Semantics (ALPS) [I-D.draft-amundsen-richardson-foster-alps] in HAL
   documents [I-D.draft-kelly-json-hal] and [I-D.draft-michaud-xml-hal],
   ALPS bindings for the HAL media-types (application/hal+json and
   application/hal+xml) must be defined.

   This specification establishes conventions required for consistent
   expression of Application Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) in HAL
   documents.

2.  Requirements

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

3.  A Review of ALPS Principles

Internet-Draft   ALPS Bindings for the HAL media-types    March 17, 2017


   The Application-Level Profile Semantics (ALPS) [I-D.draft-amundsen-
   richardson-foster-alps] specification is designed to describe the
   data elements and state transitions that make up a problem domain
   (e.g. micro-blogging, accounting, etc.). ALPS documents are designed
   to be useful to both client and server implementers and can be used
   at both run-time and design-time to handle the generation and
   interpretation of response representations. ALPS description
   documents are referred to as "profiles" or "profile documents".

   Since the aim is to support a wide set of use cases (clients,
   servers, run-time, design-time, etc.), ALPS profiles do not describe
   the runtime behavior of any single system. Instead, ALPS profiles
   describe the problem domain boundaries (e.g. the possible data
   elements and possible state transitions). It is up to implementers to
   decide how they wish to use ALPS profiles in order to create an
   actual service instance or client application.

4.  Servers and Clients

   For server implementers, ALPS profiles establish the list of possible
   identifiers for data values (givenName, familyName, etc.) and
   transitions (publish, createUser, etc). ALPS profiles also provide
   additional description information for state transitions including
   whether the transition is safe, idempotent or unsafe and, in some
   cases, whether there are any possible arguments that can be passed
   with each transition.

   Client implementers can use the same ALPS document as a guide for
   what to expect from a service which advertises support for an ALPS
   profile. For example, if a service announces that it uses the ALPS
   profile for micro-blogging, then any client application that was
   built to support the micro-blogging profile SHOULD be able to
   recognize all the important data elements and state transitions
   emitted by that service.

5.  Advertising ALPS Profiles for HAL Representations

   Servers returning HAL documents MUST only advertise the ALPS profiles
   they support using one of the following methods

5.1.  HAL profile and type relations

   HAL documents SHOULD use the profile and type relations in a HAL
   Link. The profile relation value SHOULD be set to the URL of the ALPS
   profile document and the type relation [RFC6903] SHOULD be set to the
   URL of the ALPS profile, or a URI fragment referencing a
   descriptor.id that exists in the referenced ALPS profile.

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/service"
       },
       "profile": {
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/accounting"
       },
       "type": {
         "href": "http://example.org/profiles/accounting"
       }
     }
   }

   As application/hal+xml:

   <resource rel="self" href="/service">
     <link rel="profile" href="http://example.org/profiles/accounting"/>
     <link rel="type" href="http://example.org/profiles/accounting"/>
   </resource>

5.2.  Link Header

   Responses can include the Link header, in conformance with [RFC5988],
   with the href value set to the URL of the ALPS profile document or
   type and the rel value set to "profile" or "type"".

   Link: <http://example.org/profiles/accounting>; rel="profile",
   <http://alps.io/profiles/accounting#invoice>;rel="type"

5.3.  Additional Considerations

   It is valid for a service to advertise support for more than one ALPS
   profile for the same response. For example, a single response from a
   server MAY include multiple HAL profile relations.

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "self": {
         "href": "/service"
       },
       "profile": [{
         "href": "/profiles/accounting"
       },

       {
         "href": "/profiles/finance"
       }],
       "type": [{
         "href": "/profiles/accounting"
       },
       {
         "href": "/profiles/finance"
       }]
     }
   }

   In the above case, the client application has been informed that the
   response MAY contain data elements and state transitions from both
   the finance and the accounting ALPS profiles.

   Clients accepting HAL documents SHOULD look for the ALPS profile in
   each of the mentioned places (.e.g. Link Header, HAL Profile
   Relation), as appropriate to the response. If an ALPS profile
   reference appears in more than one location, all profiles SHOULD be
   considered valid.

6.  Basic Mapping Rules for ALPS to HAL

6.1.  ALPS descriptor properties property

6.1.1.  id

   The descriptor.id, used in conjunction with the descriptor.type set
   to "semantic", without an ALPS.descriptor.name, MUST be transformed
   into a "namespaced" or "CURIE syntax" property with the same name as
   the descriptor.id.

   Below are valid examples for both the application/hal+json and the
   application/hal+xml media-types:

   <!-- ALPS document fragment -->
   <descriptor id="section" type="semantic">
     <descriptor id="name" type="semantic" />
     <descriptor id="description" type="semantic" />
   </descriptor>

   As application/hal+json:

   {
     "_links": {
       "curies": [{
         "href": "/profiles/hcli#{rel}",

         "name": "alps",
         "templated": true
       }],
       "profile": [{
         "href": "/profiles/hcli"
       }],
       "type": [{
         "href": "/profiles/hcli"
       }]
     },
     "alps:section": [{
       "alps:name": "name",
       "alps:description": "jsonf - a simple formatter for JSON"
     }, {
       "alps:name": "synopsis",
       "alps:description": "jsonf <command>"
     }]
   }

   As application/hal+xml:

   <resource xmlns:alps="/profiles/hcli#">
     <link rel="profile" href="/profiles/hcli"/>
     <link rel="type" href="/profiles/hcli"/>
     <alps:section>
       <alps:name>name</alps:name>
       <alps:description>A simple formatter for JSON</alps:description>
     </alps:section>
     <alps:section>
       <alps:name>synopsis</alps:name>
       <alps:description>jsonf &lt;command&gt;</alps:description>
     </alps:section>
   </resource>

   One notable exception exists when a semantic descriptor.type contains
   a non-semantic descriptor.type. This is covered in a later section
   covering descriptor.type.

6.1.1.1.  Simple Form

   To promote simplicity, in the HAL spirit, and when more complex
   descriptor.id disambiguation is not necessary, this specification
   allows for the omission of "namespaced" or "CURIE syntax"
   identifiers.

   The descriptor.id and the ALPS.descriptor.type set to "semantic" MAY
   be transformed into a HAL document property with the same name as the
   descriptor.id, but without namespace or CURIE syntax dereference.

   Servers MAY choose to represent HAL documents using either the
   complex form or the simple form, in which case clients that
   understand ALPS bindings for HAL should be ready to process both
   forms of HAL documents.

   Semantics for ALPS profiles that attempt to disambiguate non-unique
   descriptor.id by using the descriptor.name are undefined under this
   specification.

6.1.2.  name

   The descriptor.name property semantics are undefined in the semantic
   descriptor case and SHOULD NOT be used.

   The descriptor.name property semantics are otherwise defined and MAY
   be used in non-semantic descriptor case to help differentiate between
   otherwise identical descriptor.id and HAL link relation id.

   An example of descriptor.name use is included in the section covering
   "safe, unsafe, or idempotent" descriptor.type.

6.1.3.  type

6.1.3.1. semantic

   Coverage for the descriptor.type property with a value of "semantic"
   is covered under sections covering descriptor.id and descriptor.name.

   However, an important exception to the semantic descriptor.id case is
   when a semantic descriptor contains a single non-semantic descriptor.
   Such cases lead to the formation of linked resources or embedded
   resources, or both, in a HAL document. Determination of whether
   formation leads to the presence of a link, an embedded resource, or
   both, is left to service implementers.

   If a service presents a link, the link should use the non-semantic
   descriptor.id as the link relation. The HAL "profile" link property
   SHOULD contain a URI to the ALPS profile and the HAL "type" link
   property SHOULD contain a URI to the ALPS profile followed by a URI
   fragment referencing the descriptor.id of the child non-semantic
   descriptor.id.

   If a service presents an embedded resource, the embedded resource
   SHOULD contain a "profile" link relation referencing the URI of the
   ALPS profile, a "type" link relation referencing the URI of the ALPS
   profile and fragment referencing the descriptor.id of the child non-

   Semantics for a semantic descriptor containing multiple peer non-
   semantic descriptors are undefined.

6.1.3.2. safe, unsafe, or idempotent

   If a non-semantic descriptor is otherwise not embedded in a semantic
   descriptor, then it SHOULD only yield the formation of a templated
   link (a form). Notably, the HAL profile and type properties SHOULD be
   absent. The descriptor.id value should be used as the name of the
   value to fill in the URI template.

   The "namespaced" or "CURIE syntax" SHOULD NOT be used in the
   expansion variable of the URI template. the "namespaced" or "CURIE
   syntax" MAY however be used for the link relation, as needed, and as
